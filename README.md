# Skate Path

## Description

The main goal of this project is an app that will track a user's location on a map, and draw a line representing the user's live path. This line can also be used to calculate distance and other stats.

-- As of November 11, 2022, the original goal of line drawing and distance calculation is now available on the <a href='https://Glitch0320.github.io/skatespot'>deployed web page</a>. From here on out, I would like to continually update this application to improve the overall functionallity and design. Once I have edited a new feature well enough that the app functions as expected, then I will obtain user feedback in order to expand on my overall goal. When the new feature has been created and tested, I will again gather feedback data so that I can continue to create new features, as well as improve current features so that ultimately I end up with a deployed application that is performant, user friendly, secure, and reliable.

As of now, the creation of this web page has introduced me to the functionality of <a href='https://leafletjs.com/'>Leaflet</a> and challenged my current skills as a programmer.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Goals

-- As of right now, the user is promptly asked for their location on page load, which is not a great user experience. When implementing this idea with a react app, I intend to make sure each user is registered any information regarding their location is stored safely in a mongoose database.

I would like to expand the overlay interface to allow the user to select units of measure, as well as a setting to choose what size the path increments should be (Anywhere from 6 to 30 meters, or roughly 20 to 100 feet)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
