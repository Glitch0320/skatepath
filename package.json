It may be very useful to\r         incorporate <a href='https://www.thepocketlab.com/store/pocketlab-voyager?hsCtaTracking=f6b2ce89-1756-4590-a17e-a5002c3fa740%7C780d6f6e-1667-4d93-be25-98dcb00daf32'>PocketLab Voyager</a> so that a user can purchase a sensor to attach to their mode of transport. Data taken from these\r         sensors could bring about the creation of other features, as well as test and improve existing features for users who don't\r         want to purchase one of these sensors.\r     </li>\r </ul>",
